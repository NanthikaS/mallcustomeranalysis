Steps to be followed for customer analysis
1)import the dataset
2)prepocess the dataset
3)prepare a profiling report for the following dataset
4)Analysis the data using the 3D model
5) We have to analysis the dataset using the k-means clustering . K refers to the number of clusters. To identify the number of clusters we use elbow method.

  From our analysis from the elbow we tried both with 4 clusters and 5 clusters. 5 clusters gives the maximum amount of accuracy. Adding the legends and the changing the color for the cluster will makes the plot looks neat and clear. silhoutte score is also used as a metrics for measuring the acccuracy of the algorithm.Finally , we clustered the annual income and the spending score using hierarchical clustering.
